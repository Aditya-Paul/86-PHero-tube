            <p>Ans: Var works on globally, it doesn,t matter from where are you want to access. On the other hand let and const works depend on scope, if you want to access let and const you have to be in the scope or nested scope where you let and const already declared.</p>

            <h4 class="text-2xl text-red-400 mb-2">Q2.Tell us the use cases of null and undefined</h4>
            <p> Ans: Null:
                <br>
                1.  Null can be used to initialize variables before they are assigned a specific value.
                <br>
                2. Use null to represent missing data.
                <br>
                3. During execution return null to signal that something went wrong.
                <br>
                Undefined:
                <br>
                1. It indicate that a function does not have a meaningful return value.
                <br>
                2. Developers can use this behavior to check if a particular property is defined or not within an object.
                <br>
                3. This can be used for function existence checks.
